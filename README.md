# 📘 School Roster Management System (Excel Project)

## 📊 Project Overview

This project is an Excel-based School Roster Management System designed to streamline and automate the process of tracking student academic performance. Developed for use in a real educational setting, the system eliminates the repetitive and time-consuming tasks of manual roster preparation.

It automatically calculates key metrics such as total marks, average scores, student rankings, and pass/fail status based on predefined criteria. In addition, it includes a dynamic summary report that breaks down student performance by gender and score range — providing valuable insights into overall class performance.

One of the standout features of the system is its ability to automatically identify the top 10 students and to generate individual student report cards, all within the same workbook.

This project showcases practical data management and analysis using Excel and demonstrates how everyday school administrative processes can be simplified through basic data automation skills.
